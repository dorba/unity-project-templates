# About _URP Base_

This is an empty URP template, derived from the Unity sample URP 3D project, with the following changes:

- Example assets are removed
- Unity editor version 2020.3 is targeted
- URP version 10.5.1 is used by default
- The new input system is enabled
- Cinemachine is included by default
- The default project layout for local assets is under Assets/app/*
- The empty scene has nothing but a cube, easily used as a blank starting point
